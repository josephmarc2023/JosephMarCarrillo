      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello, my name is Joseph Mar Carrillo, and I graduated from Cebu Technological University with a degree in Hospitality Management. 
        I have extensive experience working in various roles such as Administrative Aid, Customer Service Representative, Operations Supervisor, 
        Travel Consultant, and Data Research Analyst. After completing a Data Analytics Bootcamp at Refocus and a Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp at 
        StackTreck and DICT, I decided to shift my career towards IT with a focus on data analytics and web development.
      </p>

        When I'm not working, I enjoy playing Dota2, an online multiplayer video game. I bring a strong attention to detail and a dedicated work ethic 
        to my job. With my skills and experience, I'm confident that I can make a positive contribution to any organization that values hard work, 
        innovation, and excellence. Thank you for taking the time to read my about me page, and I look forward to the opportunity to work with you in 
        the future.
